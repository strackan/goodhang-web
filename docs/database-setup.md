- Enums for membership tiers, application status, user roles
- Row Level Security policies
- Indexes for performance
- Raleigh region seed data

**How to run**:
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy entire contents of `001_initial_schema.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Verify: "Success. No rows returned"

capacity: 100  -- Your actual capacity
```

**How to run**:

## Migration 003: Seed Founding Members

**File**: `supabase/migrations/003_seed_founding_members.sql`

**What it does**:
- Provides template for making yourself admin
- Shows how to update member profiles

**How to use**:
1. First, sign up at `/login` to create your account
2. Then run this to make yourself admin:
```sql
UPDATE profiles
SET
  name = 'Your Name',
  bio = 'Your bio here',
  role = 'Founder & CEO',
  company = 'Renubu',
  linkedin_url = 'https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile',
  interests = ARRAY['AI', 'GTM', 'Community Building'],
  user_role = 'admin',
  membership_tier = 'free'
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

## Row Level Security Policies

### Profiles
- âœ… Everyone can view profiles
- âœ… Users can update their own profile

### Applications
- âœ… Anyone can submit applications
- âœ… Only admins can view/update applications

### Events
- âœ… Public events viewable by everyone
- âœ… Admins and ambassadors can create events
- âœ… Creators can update their events

### RSVPs
- âœ… Anyone can view RSVPs for public events
- âœ… Active members can create RSVPs (or guests without user_id)
- âœ… Users can delete their own RSVPs

### Regions
- âœ… Everyone can view regions
- âœ… Only admins can manage regions

---

## Testing Database Setup

### 1. Verify Tables Created

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Should show: applications, events, profiles, regions, rsvps

### 2. Check Raleigh Region

```sql
SELECT * FROM regions;
```

Should show one region: Raleigh

### 3. Test Profile Creation

Sign up at `/login`, then check:
```sql
SELECT id, email, name, user_role FROM profiles;
```

### 4. Make Yourself Admin

```sql
UPDATE profiles
SET user_role = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

Verify:
```sql
SELECT email, user_role FROM profiles WHERE user_role = 'admin';
```

## Common Issues

**Issue: "relation does not exist"**
- Migration 001 wasn't run
- Run the initial schema migration first

**Issue: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"**
- Trying to run a migration twice
- Check if data already exists before inserting

**Issue: "permission denied for table"**
- RLS policies blocking access
- Make sure you're admin or check policies

**Issue: Can't see profiles after signup**
- Profile not created automatically
- Supabase Auth creates user, but profile table is separate
- Need to create profile manually or via trigger

---

## Adding More Members

### Option 1: They Sign Up
1. Share `/login` link
2. They create account
3. You update their profile via SQL or admin dashboard

### Option 2: Manual Creation (Not Recommended)
Only use for testing. Real users should sign up.

```sql
-- Don't do this for real members!
-- This is for testing only
```

---

## Backup & Restore

### Create Backup
```sql
-- In Supabase, go to Database â†’ Backups
-- Enable daily backups
-- Download current backup if needed
```

### Restore from Backup
- Supabase Pro plan includes automatic backups
- Can restore via dashboard
- Free tier: Manual exports only

## Next Steps

After setting up the database:
1. âœ… Sign up at `/login`
2. âœ… Make yourself admin
3. âœ… Update your profile with bio, interests
4. âœ… Create the launch event with real details
5. âœ… Test RSVP flow
6. âœ… Invite founding members to sign up

Your database is ready for launch! ðŸš€
